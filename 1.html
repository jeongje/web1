    Maybe I just want to breathe maybe I just don't believe
    Maybe you're the same as me we see things they'll never see you and I were gonna live forever<img width="100%" src="coding.jpg"></p><p style="margin-top:45px;">Oasis were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. Developed from an earlier group, the Rain, the band originally consisted of Liam Gallagher (vocals, tambourine), Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs (guitar), Paul "Guigsy" McGuigan (bass guitar), and Tony McCarroll (drums). Upon returning to Manchester, Liam's older brother, Noel Gallagher (lead guitar, vocals) joined as a fifth member, which formed the band's core and settled line-up. During the course of their existence, they have undergone various line-up changes.</p>
